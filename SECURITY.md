## Django app detected with DEBUG mode enabled in "**/settings.py**"

### Description

Running a Django application in debug mode may give an attacker access to sensitive information. Ensure that `DEBUG` is set to `False` in Django applications that are run in a production environment.

Debug mode assists developers in finding bugs by providing system and user information. The data could be classified as sensitive. If enabled in a production environment, this data can provide attackers with information about the underlying tools, application settings, and so on. It is recommended that development-specific settings be configured in another file (say, `settings.py`).
